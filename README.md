This is for assignment 1, the Turing machine.  <BR>

To make and run this program: <BR>
1)  Place all files and place into a local directory (ex: "/u/ceinfo/test"). <BR>
2)  Make sure the .java, .dat, and makefile are located in the same directory (ex: "/u/ceinfo/test"). <BR>
3)  Run:  "cd /u/ceinfo/test" <BR>
4)  Run:  "./makefile" <BR>
5)  The makefile automatically compiles the main java program,  then executes the fibonacci program, then executes the powersOfTwo program, then executes the addSub program.  <BR>


To run the program once the code is compiled: <BR>
1) Run:  "java TuringTest <inputfile>"  (ex:  "java TuringTest fibonacci.dat") <BR>

Thanks!<BR>
