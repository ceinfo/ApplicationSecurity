This is for assignment 1, the Turing machine.  

To make and run this program:
1)  place all files and place into a local directory (ex: "/u/ceinfo/test").
2)  make sure the .java, .dat, and makefile are located in the same directory (ex: "/u/ceinfo/test").
3)  Run:  "cd /u/ceinfo/test"
4)  Run:  "./makefile"
5)  The makefile automatically compiles the main java program,  then executes the fibonacci program, then executes the powersOfTwo program, then executes the addSub program.  


To run the program once the code is compiled:
1) Run:  "java TuringTest <inputfile>"  (ex:  "java TuringTest fibonacci.dat")

Thanks!
